Installation instructions:

First, git clone the repository. Then, in the root directory, run the command yarn install.

For iOS, cd into the /ios folder and run the command pod install.

Lastly, to run the app, run these commands:
iOS: react-native run-ios
Android: react-native run-android

For Android, if you have upgraded by your Mac OS to Big Sur recently, then this Stack Overflow post might help if you run into an error:

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any problems in running the app! I have found running React Native on a development platform to be a tad fickle. Errors can sometimes seemingly come out of nowhere, and sometimes it's as simple as emptying your cache (which the error message will often suggest). I have tested the Android and iOS versions and they work on my machine, but if they do not work yours, let me know and I will work with you on it.
